# Introduction to DevOps
- The engineering discipline of optimizing both **Development** and **Operations** to enable the realization of 
  business goals through rapid feedback, stable, responsive and flexible IT.
  - **Development** teams focus on changes to be implemented.
  - **Operations** team focus on stability of the currently implemented system.


#### Purpose of DevOps
- Reduction of cost and risk.
- Increase in speed of delivery.
- Enable agile delivery, increase of software quality, and cross-team collaboration.

## DevOps Pipelines
- Build and deploy code depending on a schedule, on-demand, or a certain event.

### DevOps Pipeline Components
A **Pipeline** is a scripted workflow of various processes.

#### 1. Continuous Integration
- The point in the workflow where raw code is collected, compiled, and run some validation against it.
- Basically anything else that is need to do to build the software.

#### 2. Continuous Delivery
- Ensuring that the post build software is in a releasable state.
- Ensure that a test has been run and it was approved. 
- States that the change can go to production with minimal risk. 

#### 3. Continuous Deployment
- Automating continuous delivery to the point that the deployment of the software to production systems happens 
  automatically.

#### 4. Continuous Feedback
- Receiving feedback from stakeholders.


#### 5. Continuous Testing
- Ability to automatically validate that the software is doing what it is supposed to before releasing it to production.

#### 6. Continuous Monitoring
- Capture the metrics of the system where the software is being deployed into.


#### 7. Continuous Operations
- Post pipeline run component.
